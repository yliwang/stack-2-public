stack-2, as we already know, stack can be seen as first-in-last-out, or last-in-first-out list, so in this project, one is required to implement operations for a stack, using the source files provided for list. You can only edit code in stack.c and main.c, and leave code in defs. and stack.h list.h, list.c un-touched.
Even though, you can submit all files for this assignment, only code in stack.c is taken for grading.
